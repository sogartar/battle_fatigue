# Battle Fatigue

This is a mod for Battle Brothers that adds the "Battle Fatigue" mechanic.

## Motivation

Playing the game optimally in sense of advancing the company faster in terms
of in-game days requires you to not pass on fights if they are in your path.
There is no downside to it. In this setting most of the fights are not
challenging and do not pose a threat to your bros. Much of the game's fun
comes from gambling with the fate of your bros and having a reasonable chance
of losing a good bro.

With this in mind, this mod makes the decision to take on an easy fight not a
clear cut decision.

## Description

The "Battle Fatigue" effect gives a temporary penalty to
maximum fatigue and resolve when a brother participates in a battle. It has
the following effects and mechanics.

For each battle round after the first 2, accumulate -2 maximum fatigue and -1 resolve per round.
The maximum penalty per battle is -5 to maximum fatigue and -2.5 to resolve.
The effect is applied after the battle.  
Will recover 50% per day of the penalty to maximum fatigue to a minimum of 4 per day.  
Will recover 25% per day of the penalty to resolve to a minimum of 2 per day.
The resolve penalty can be treated in a temple. It will reduce the penalty by 66%.

## Explanation

With this mod chaining fights has a cost and it may become significant,
weakening your company for the big fights. Maximum fatigue is reduced twice as
much each fight, but if the penalty becomes high enough it will recover
faster. The resolve penalty accumulates slower, but it will recover slower
when high. You may need to hit the temple to continue taking fights in a fast pace.

Quick fights will result in less of a hit to maximum fatigue and resolve.
If a fight is finished in less than 5 rounds, the penalty will be lower, allowing
to take 1 or more fights per day without accumulating a large penalty.
Retreating in the beginning of a fort battle on easy terrain would result in
a single turn penalty. For normal fights and if on rough terrain retreating is not fast
enough and some of your bros will get more battle fatigued.

Because of reduced battle frequency your bros will have lower morale and having
a drink in the tavern is more valuable.
